# Online-Examination-System
The project is developed using java server pages (jsp) and MySQL for database.
IDE is the Netbeans.
sql script is included in "db script" folder.

create exam_system as a database.
database settings are in DatabaseClass.java.
you can modify it or default settings are:
db name:  exam_system
user:     root
pass:     

the table user is already filled with some users.
Thanks
